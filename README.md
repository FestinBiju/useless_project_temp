### Project Description
Our app removes the hectic job of finding something rare and reports it. It's a fun and ultimately useless app designed to make the mundane slightly more entertaining by giving random items a "rarity score" and celebrating it with confetti.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Finding out how rare everyday items are is typically not a concern for most people, but we decided to tackle this "problem" by assigning a rarity score to whatever users input, whether common or legendary.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We developed an app that takes any item name as input, determines its rarity based on predefined criteria, and celebrates rare items with a fun confetti animation. No practical benefits, but plenty of fun!
